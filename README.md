# Futsal Fatigue and Landing Mechanics — Elite Female Players

This repository hosts a Next.js application that presents a Q1-style original research article with a simulated dataset on the effects of futsal-specific functional fatigue on shock absorption strategies and lower extremity kinematics during single-leg landing in elite female futsal players.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

### Develop
```bash
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deploy (Vercel CLI)
The app can be deployed with Vercel CLI:
```bash
vercel deploy --prod --yes --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --name agentic-16079bbc
```

## Project structure
